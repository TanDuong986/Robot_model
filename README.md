# robot_model_gazebo

This is repo for simulate a mobile robot with diffirential wheel. I created a [matrix map](Robot_model/worlds) for a virtual environment. 

This robot equip with `hokuyo lidar` and `kinect camera`

Clone this repo and run [robot_model_gazebo.launch](Robot_model/launch/robot_model_gazebo.launch) to display robot on RViz, I had save a config of RViz in [here](Robot_model/robot_model_gazebo.rviz) and generate an environment on Gazebo

To make robot moving, use any code that you like to put velocity in `/cmd_vel` topic to control robot.

I'm continue Updating this repo ... :rocket: :rocket: :rocket:
